## Summary: exercise description

An optician, called “Cul d'Ampolla”, wants to computerize the management of customers and sales of glasses.

First of all, the optician wants to know who the supplier of each pair of glasses is. Specifically, it wants to know about each supplier:
The name
The address (street, number, floor, door, city, postal code and country)
Telephone
Fax
NIF.

The optician's purchasing policy is based on the fact that glasses of a brand will be purchased from a single supplier (so it can get better prices), but it can buy glasses of several brands from one supplier. About the glasses, it wants to know:
The brand.
The prescription of each lens.
The type of frame (floating, plastic or metallic).
The color of the frame.
The color of each lens.
The price.

About the customers, it wants to store:
The name.
The postal address.
The phone number.
The email address.
The registration date.
When a new customer arrives, store the customer who recommended the establishment (provided someone recommended it).
Our system will need to indicate which employee sold each pair of glasses.

List the total invoices for a customer in a given period.
List the different models of glasses that an employee sold during a year.
List the different suppliers that have supplied glasses successfully sold by the optician.
